# SuperMarket-Management
Main features of the project:
• Multiuser views: Multiple users will be there; every user will be able to 
see only the data that is authorized to them by the Administrator. 
• Linking of two systems: inventory and billing. The linking will be made 
so that whenever the items are purchased, they will be deducted from the 
inventory. 
• Constraints: There will be a customizable constraint that is “Minimum 
quantity” for every item can be mentioned in the inventory as a constraint 
for every product. This will help us to fill the inventory whenever an item 
is about to get over. Due to this, we can eliminate product shortages by 
filling the inventory at the right time. 
• Real time tracking of the item’s quantity, that are present in the inventory
• Bills: A pdf form of the bill is made for the customer and for the suppliers
and also will be saved in the database
